#### **⚠️ HOMEPAGE "DEAD LINK" - FALSE ALARM!**
**The 1 reported "dead link" is actually:**
```javascript
// This is VALID JavaScript code, not a broken link!
href="${match.path}" // Template literal in search functionality
```

**Why it's flagged**: Our audit script mistakenly treats JavaScript template literals as static HTML links.
**Reality**: This is perfectly functional dynamic code that generates working links.
